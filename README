(in)sanity
==========

For something between the likes of a toy bootloader or tiny kernel and Arch Linux.

Currently a 32-bit ring 0 kernel but soon to become the next Linux.

Aims to remain small and to be the easiest system to add new architectures to.

Features:
- Bootloader (multiboot)
- Terminal support (print, itoa)
- R/W to I/O bus
- Global descriptor table

In progress: Interrupt descriptor table
