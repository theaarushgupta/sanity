For something between the likes of a toy bootloader or tiny kernel and Arch Linux.

Currently a 32-bit ring 0 kernel but soon to become the next Linux.

Aims to remain small and to be the easiest system to add new architectures to.

Features:
- Bootloader (multiboot)
- Hello World kernel
- Terminal support (print, itoa)
- Global descriptor table
- Interrupts descriptor table

In progress: paging and heap
